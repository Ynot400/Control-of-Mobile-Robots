# Control-of-Mobile-Robots

Using a virtual robotics simulation called Webots, this repository initializes a four wheeled simulated robot called RosBot to do program "labs" that go over Kinematics, PID controllers, Wall Following, Motion Planning with Bug Zero Algorithm, and Localization. 

The repository expands on the FAIRIS-Lite project framework, which was created by @ChanceHamilton59 on github. The framework allows for users to integrate control logic for navigation of the RosBot within the Webots simulation.




This repository expands on the FAIRIS-Lite project framework, allowing users to integrate navigational control logic into robots within the Webots simulation. It encompasses the Python controller files essential for the lab tasks specified in this course.

These controller files are crucial for simulating robot movement and sensor data within the Webots development environment. The Webots simulator, which is free and open-source, can be accessed here.

The primary outcomes of each lab are the controller files, conveniently located in WebotsSim/controllers.
